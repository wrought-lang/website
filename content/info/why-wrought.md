# Why make Wrought?

Much of the introductory content about WebAssembly starts off very simple with short examples that
 * use a limited subset of WebAssembly features,
 * use WAT or WAST to write or examine WASM modules,
 * instantiate WebAssembly modules directly using JS APIs.

The next level of content available jumps very far forward to setting up complex bundled compile-to-WebAssembly projects
using high-level programming languages like Rust, AssemblyScript, or C/C++.

This jump leaves a huge gap in mid-level practical WebAssembly examples and content.
Wrought is designed to help fill that gap and provide a tool for working at this level of abstraction.
